# Data Science skills showcasing in Python

This repository contains codes (mostly in the form of Jupyter Notebooks) of code practices from the following books:

- Python Data Clearning Cookbook
- Hands-on Data Preprocessing in Python
- Hyperparameter Tuning with Python
- Python Data Science Bookcamp
- Data Science Projects in Python

In addition to building projects with guidance from the books I have generated some synthetic data on topics that interest me and practiced data exploration, data cleaning and data visualization on the datasets. The code for the synthetic data generation are also included.
